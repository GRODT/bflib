Introduction
--------------

The best way to get started with this library is to run through the tutorial of how to
set up your first betfair connection and issue a couple of API commands. You can read 
that article here: http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1438

Secondly you could try writing a simple application, with working event navigation and
market data views based on the tutorial here: http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1442/

You should also be sure to have PHP compiled with soap and ssl support.  If you are unsure, 
the following PHP compliation works for me (with the supporting libs in place, of course):

./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs \
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql  \
--enable-pdo \
--with-pdo-mysql=/usr/local/mysql \
--with-zlib-dir=../zlib-1.2.3 \
--with-jpeg-dir=/usr/lib \
--with-curl \
--enable-soap \
--with-openssl
