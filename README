Introduction
--------------

The best way to get started with this library is to install the demo and see it 
working first.

To get started, extract the contents of the bflib archive into your document root.

Next, you should edit the classes/betfairConstants.class.php  file.  In here, you will
need to specify your Betfair username and password and the Apache virtualhost which you 
will be running the demo under.  Don't forget to include the .htaccess file in your 'www'
folder.

You should also be sure to have PHP compiled with soap and ssl support. I also recommend
using the latest version of PHP, which fixes bugs in the stream wrappers API, which can
fail when it encounters a trailing \n on the service WSDL file.  If you are unsure, the
following PHP compliation works for me (with the supporting libs in place, of course):

./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql  --enable-pdo --with-pdo-mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-zlib-dir=../zlib-1.2.3 --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/lib --with-curl --enable-soap --with-openssl


MVC
----

The bflib code is based on the MVC pattern, with the betfairDialogue class serving as the
model. This is the class which you are least likely to modify, and if you do modify it, 
it's the class you will most likely want to commit updates/patches to on github. 

The 'view' is completely domain-specific. It is very likely that you will modify the view to get it 
to construct completely different html fragments, or perhaps XML/JSON as output.  

The controller behaves as glue between the whole lot, and demonstrates how you can envoke dialogue and view
objects and pass data between them.  


Note:
---------

Please note that if you have are attempting to view the demo app straigt off your document root, you
will need to make two changes:

1) Modify the 'splitRequestParts()' method, decrementing the indedx in requestParts[<index>] by one
2) Remove 'bfapi' from the following line in your .htaccess:

	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /bflib/index.php [L]

so that it reads:

	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php [L]

By doing this, you are telling the application that your index.php file lives directly within the 
DocumentRoot and not under a subfolder.

Likewise, if you have two directory layers under the documentroot before you encounter the index.php,
you will need to increment the requestParts[<index>] value by one and reflect the new root path in your
RewriteRule.
